## Problem statement
A traffic intersection can be approached by vehicles from the North, from the East and from the West.
![Scheme](/img/scheme_1.png)

The flow of vehicles in each direction encounters a traffic light before reaching the intersection, which can be either green or red. An operator must select every 20 seconds which of the three traffic lights to turn green: the other two will automatically turn red.  
Sensors measure the level of traffic in each direction prior to the intersection. The values can be: High or Low. When the traffic light in one direction is green, the level will normally stay the same or go down, only very occasionally increasing. When the traffic light is closed, the level stays the same or rises.  
We want to design an automaton that opens the appropriate traffic light at each cycle following the optimal policy of the corresponding MDP. The target situation is that traffic in all three directions is Low. In such a situation, the automaton stops working.  
The main objective of the project is to obtain the optimal policy for the automaton.

## Input data
Historical data is available for situations where we know:
- The traffic levels at the start of the 20-second cycle
- The traffic light that remained green during that period
- The traffic levels at the end of the cycle

The historical data are in a file. Each line contains 7 values separated by ";". The first three are the traffic levels at the beginning of the 20 seconds in the order North, East, West, the fourth is the traffic light that stays green during those 20 seconds and the last three are the traffic levels at the end.  
For example, the line:
```
High;High;Low;E;High;High;High
```
indicates that we had High traffic coming in from the North and East and Low traffic from the West, the traffic light controlling incoming traffic from the East was green and within 20 seconds traffic was High in all three directions.
